Tweek api service can be configured by setting environment variables or by mounting /app/appsettings.Production.json file.
In the json format, keys are configured as nested objects:
```
{
  "Some": {
        "Module": {
            "Url": "http://module:3000"
        }
  },
}
```
The equivalent environment variable configuration is:
```
Some__Module__Url=http://module:3000
```
