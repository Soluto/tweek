The easiest way to experience Tweek, is to setup a playground environment.  
There are several ways to do it:

- Create online playground environment - using [play-with-tweek](/play-with-tweek) (quickest, experimental)
- Create local playground environment - using docker-compose

#### Local - Run Locally using docker-compose

- clone Tweek's repo (`git clone https://github.com/Soluto/tweek.git`)
- go to deployments/dev (`cd tweek/deployments/dev`)
- (optional) pull the images instead of building (`docker-compose pull --parallel`)
- run (`docker-compose up`) - this might take a few minutes the first time
