#### Edit your first key
After setting up our environment, we're going to create our first key.
Keys in tweek are the most basic building blocks and they represent a container for dynamic value that affect feature behaviors.
Our first key, will be a key that is responsible for the color of a "sign up" button.

- Open http://localhost:8080/login in browser.
- Login
    - User Basic auth (user: admin-app, password: 8v/iUG0vTH4BtVgkSn3Tng==)
    - Can also use OIDC mock server login button for testing OIDC (user: User, password: pwd)
- Go to keys page.
- Click on "Add Key"
- Type my_app/sign_button/color
- Set value type to String
- Add default value "red"
- Save changes
- Click on "Add Rule"
- Set Property to Country (user) and set "=" and "Canada" in the other fields
- In Rule value set the value "blue"
- Click "Save changes"

#### Querying Tweek
Use curl/postman/chrome to fire GET Request:
- http://localhost:8080/api/v2/values/my_app/sign_button/color -> expected to be "red"
- http://localhost:8080/api/v2/values/my_app/sign_button/color?user.Country=canada -> expected to be "blue"
- http://localhost:8080/api/v2/values/my_app/sign_button/_?user.Country=canada -> expected to be {"color":"blue"}

Using the rest api, an application can query Tweek for getting the right set of values for each specific user.
More on Tweek [Rest api](https://docs.tweek.fm/api/rest-api).

#### Adding context data

Tweek provide UI and rest api for editing context.

- Go to context
- Set Identity Type to User
- Set User id to John
- Click enter
- Set value "Candada" for property Country

After that, we can query Tweek API with:
- http://localhost:8080/api/v1/keys/my_app/sign_button/color?user=john -> expected to be "blue"

You can also use the api for updating Tweek context:
- curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v2/context/user/john \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H 'x-client-id: admin-app' \
  -H 'x-client-secret: 8v/iUG0vTH4BtVgkSn3Tng==' \
  -d '{
	"country": "Canada"
  }'

#### Gradual Feature Release
Create new key in the editor "my_app/sign_button/is_enabled" with value type "boolean" and default value False.  
Add new rule, remove all conditions, set the the rule value to gradual release with 50%.
Try querying configuration with different users and You'll have different results.
- http://localhost:8080/api/v1/keys/my_app/sign_button/is_enabled?user=barny
- http://localhost:8080/api/v1/keys/my_app/sign_button/is_enabled?user=robin
- http://localhost:8080/api/v1/keys/my_app/sign_button/is_enabled?user=ted
- http://localhost:8080/api/v1/keys/my_app/sign_button/is_enabled?user=lily
- etc...
