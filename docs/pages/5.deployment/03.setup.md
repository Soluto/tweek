Tweek use RSA keys for communication between the services, and for accessing git storage.

### Generating keys

In order to generate this keys, use the script in Tweek repo:
`https://github.com/Soluto/tweek/blob/master/utils/generate_keys.sh`

### Mounting the keys

In each service you should mount the relevant files, and configure the service using environment variables:

- GIT (public)
  - PUBLIC_KEY_PATH=/run/secrets/id_rsa.pub
- API (pfx)
  - PUBLIC_KEY_PATH=/run/secrets/certificate.pfx
- Editor (private)
  - GIT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=/run/secrets/id_rsa
- Authoring (private, public)
  - GIT_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH=/run/secrets/id_rsa.pub
  - GIT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=/run/secrets/id_rsa
- Publishing (private, public)
  - GIT_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH=/run/secrets/id_rsa.pub
- Gateway (Private)
  - TWEEKGATEWAY_SECURITY_TWEEKSECRETKEY_PATH=/run/secrets/tweek_ssh_private_key

All public/private keys can be also consumed as base64 value environment variables (add example).

### Linking Git repository

Publishing service should work against an upstream git repo (can be hosted anywhere, Github, Gitlab, CodeCommit, etc...):

- Publishing
  - GIT_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH=/run/secrets/tweek_ssh_public_key
  - GIT_SERVER_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=/run/secrets/id_rsa # or use a different one, depend on upstream
  - GIT_UPSTREAM_URI=ssh://git@git/tweek/repo

### Linking Between services

Most services are configured by default to talk to each other, but if you want to customize it:

- Api
  - -> Minio
  - -> Nats
- Publishing
  - -> Minio
  - -> Nats
- Gateway
  - -> Minio
  - -> Nats
  - -> Api
  - -> Authoring
  - -> Publishing
  - -> Editor
- [Optional] Editor -> Gateway (REACT_APP_GATEWAY_URL)

### Example configurations

You can checkout [dev](https://github.com/Soluto/tweek/blob/master/deployments/dev) folder for compose/swarm configuration docker-compose.

There's a also a [Kubernetes example](https://github.com/Soluto/tweek/tree/master/deployments/kubernetes)
